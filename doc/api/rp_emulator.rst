RPE API: :f:mod:`rp_emulator.mod`
=================================


Derived types
=============

.. f:type:: rpe_var

   A type representing a reduced-precision floating-point number.
   This type stores the number it represents internally.

   :f INTEGER sbits: Number of bits in the significand of the floating-point number
   :f REAL val [KIND=RPE_REAL_KIND]: The real value stored within the instance.


User-callable procedures
========================


.. f:function:: rpe_literal (x, n)

   Construct an :f:type:`rpe_var` instance from a value.
   Optionally a number of significand bits used to store the value may be given.
   The value will be truncated before storage.
   A typical usage of this constructor is to support reduced precision literal values without having to declare extra variables:

   .. code-block:: fortran

      type(rpe_var) :: a, b, c, d, e

      RPE_DEFAULT_SBITS = 10

      ! variables a, b and c have a 10-bit significands:
      a = 5.00
      b = 7.23
      c = 21.12

      ! The literals 7.29e-5, 3.14 and 18.17 have full precision
      ! (a 23-bit significand):
      d = 7.29e-5 * a + 3.14 * b + 18.17 * c  ! d = 406.5

      ! The literals are replaced by rpe_var instances with 10-bit significands:
      e = rpe_literal(7.29e-5) * a + rpe_literal(3.14) * b + rpe_literal(18.17) * c  ! e = 406.75

   :param x [IN]: A real or integer value to store in the resulting :f:type:`rpe_var` instance.
   :param integer n [IN,OPTIONAL]: An optional number of significand bits used to represent the number, equivalent of setting the :f:var:`sbits` attribute of an :f:type:`rpe_var` instance. If not specified then the resulting :f:type:`rpe_var` will use the default precision specified by :f:var:`RPE_DEFAULT_SBITS`.

   .. note::

      If you use this to create an :f:type:`rpe_var` instance and then assign the result to another instance, only the value will be copied:

      .. code-block:: fortran

         ! An rpe_var instance with a 13 bit significand:
         type(rpe_var) :: a
         a%sbits = 13

         ! Construct an rpe_type instance with a 15-bit significand and assign to a,
         ! the value will be truncated to 13 bits and the variable a will continue
         ! to store only 13 significand bits.
         a = rpe_literal(1.23456789, 15)


.. f:subroutine:: apply_truncation (rpe)
   :attrs: elemental

   Apply the required truncation to the value stored within an :f:type:`rpe_var` instance.
   Operates on the input in-place, modifying its value.
   The truncation is determined by the :f:var:`sbits` attribute of the :f:type:`rpe_var` instance, if this is not set then the value of :f:var:`RPE_DEFAULT_SBITS`.

   :param rpe_var rpe [INOUT]: The :f:type:`rpe_var` instance to alter the precision of.


.. f:function:: significand_bits (x)
   :attrs: elemental

   Determine the number of significand bits being used by the input types.
   For inputs that are :f:type:`rpe_var` instances this function returns the number of significand bits in use by the reduced-precision number.
   For real numbers it will return either 23 for single-precision inputs or 52 for double-precision inputs.
   For all other input types the result will be zero.

   :param x [IN]: Any Fortran type.


Variables
=========

.. f:variable:: RPE_ACTIVE
   :type: LOGICAL
   :attrs: default=.TRUE.

   Logical value determining whether emulation is on or off.
   If set to ``.FALSE.`` then calls to :f:subr:`apply_truncation` will have no effect and all operations will be carried out at full precision.


.. f:variable:: RPE_DEFAULT_SBITS
   :type: INTEGER
   :attrs: default=52

   The default number of bits used in the significand of an :f:type:`rpe_var` instance when not explicitly specified.
   This takes effect internally when determining precision levels, but does not bind an :f:type:`rpe_var` instance to a particular precision level (doesn't set :f:var:`rpe_var%sbits`).


.. f:variable:: RPE_IEEE_HALF
   :type: LOGICAL
   :attrs: default=.FALSE.

   Logical value determining if IEEE half-precision emulation is turned on.
   If set to ``.TRUE.`` and a 10-bit significand is being emulated the emulator will additionally impose range constraints when applying truncation:

   * Values that overflow IEEE half-precision will lead to real overflows with a corresponding floating-point overflow exception.
   * Values out of the lower range of IEEE half-precision will be denormalised.

   This option only affects the emulation when emulating a 10-bit significand.


.. f:variable:: RPE_IEEE_ROUNDING
   :type: LOGICAL
   :attrs: default=.FALSE.

    Logical value determining if full IEEE 754 rounding rules should be used.
    If ``.TRUE.`` then a *"round to nearest, tie to even"* rounding scheme will be used, which proceeds as normal rounding to the nearest representable number, except in the special case where a number is halfway between two representations where it will be rounded so that the least significant bit of the results is a zero.
    If ``.FALSE.`` then then rounding scheme rounds numbers halfway between two representations to the representation with larger absolute value.

    .. admonition:: Transitioning to new behaviour
       :class: danger

       This option is provided to ease the transition to a new IEEE 754 compliant rounding mode.
       In version 5.0 this option will be removed and the only rounding mode will be IEEE.
       You can use this option to test your code with the new rounding mode prior to moving to version 5.0 when it is released.


Parameters
==========

.. f:variable:: RPE_DOUBLE_KIND
   :type: INTEGER

   The kind number for double precision real types.

.. f:variable:: RPE_SINGLE_KIND
   :type: INTEGER

   The kind number for single precision real types.

.. f:variable:: RPE_REAL_KIND
   :type: INTEGER

   The kind number of the real-values held by reduced precision types.
   This is a reference to :f:var:`RPE_DOUBLE_KIND`, but could be changed (in source) to be :f:var:`RPE_SINGLE_KIND`.

.. f:variable:: RPE_ALTERNATE_KIND
   :type: INTEGER

   The kind number of an alternate type of real-value.
   This is a reference to :f:var:`RPE_SINGLE_KIND`, but can be changed (in source) if the value referenced by :f:var:`RPE_REAL_KIND` is changed.
