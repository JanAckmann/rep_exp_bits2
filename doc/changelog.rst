Changelog
=========

v3.1.x
------

:Release: v3.1.1
:Date: 3 November 2015

* License code under the Apache 2.0 license.

:Release: v3.1.0
:Date: 16 October 2015

* Support for IEEE half-precision emulation via the `RPE_IEEE_HALF` module variable.


v3.0.x
------

:Release: v3.0.1
:Date: 4 November 2015

* License code under the Apache 2.0 license.

:Release: v3.0.1
:Date: 21 August 2015

* Features

  * Support for different precision levels in different variables:

    * You can set the `%sbits` attribute of any `rpe_type` instance to define
      the number of significand bits used by that variable.

  * A set of unit tests is included to help us ensure the emulator core is robust.

  * HTML documentation is included with the source (requires Sphinx to build).

* Incompatibilities

  * This version is incompatible with the v2.0.x series.

  * The public API is now smaller, including only the required parts of the library.

  * Module variables renamed: `RPE_BITS` -> `RPE_DEFAULT_SBITS`

  * Reduction of precision subroutine renamed: `reduce_precision` -> `apply_truncation`

  * Internal differences to support mixed precision may cause different
    results to previous versions.


v2.0.x
------

:Release: 2.0.1
:Date: 3 November 2015

* License code under the Apache 2.0 license.

:Release: 2.0.0
:Date: 29 July 2015

* Features

  * Reduce precision on assignment:

    * The precision of the value held within an `rpe_type` instance is reduced
      whenever a value is assigned, meaning an `rpe_var` instance cannot ever
      store a full precision value, and an `rpe_shadow` type will always store
      a reduced precision value when it has been assigned to directly (but one
      can of course assign a full precision value to the variable it is
      shadowing and have that value retained).

    * Explicit calls to `reduce_precision` are no longer required in any
      overloaded operators or intrinsic routines, as the reduction of precision
      will be performed implicitly on assignment of the result.

* Incompatibilities

  * The change from explicit reduction of precision within overloaded operators
    and intrinsics will likely cause the emulator to return different results
    than the v1.0.x series.


v1.0.x
------

:Release: v1.0.1
:Date: 4 November 2015

* License code under the Apache 2.0 license.

:Release: 1.0.0
:Date: 28 July 2015

* Features

  * Initial version used operationally for experiments.
