==============

A large amount of the code included in the Fortran library is constructed programmatically by a code generator.
The code generator is a small library written in Python, that uses templates to generate fortran code, as well as front-ends to generate the required functions, subroutines and interface blocks for all overloaded operators and instrinsic functions.
